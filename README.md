# Happiness Index Analysis

This project focuses on analyzing the World Happiness Index data from 2015 to 2019. The dataset contains various factors contributing to happiness scores across different countries. We perform exploratory data analysis (EDA), outlier detection, and correlation analysis to gain insights into the relationship between happiness scores and various socio-economic factors.

## Introduction

The World Happiness Index is a landmark survey that ranks countries based on their levels of happiness and well-being. This project aims to analyze the factors influencing happiness scores and explore trends over multiple years. By examining the correlation between happiness scores and various socio-economic indicators, we seek to identify key drivers of happiness across different regions.

## Data Loading and Preprocessing

We load and preprocess data from the years 2015 to 2019, including features such as GDP per capita, social support, life expectancy, freedom, and corruption perception. Data preprocessing involves handling missing values, encoding categorical variables, and scaling numerical features to prepare the data for analysis.

## Exploratory Data Analysis

We conduct exploratory data analysis to visualize trends and patterns in the happiness index over time. This includes plotting happiness scores, analyzing regional distributions, and comparing scores across different years. Additionally, we explore the distribution of key features and their impact on happiness scores.

## Outlier Detection

Outliers can significantly affect the analysis and interpretation of data. We employ outlier detection techniques to identify countries with extreme values in key features such as GDP per capita, life expectancy, and corruption perception. By removing outliers, we ensure robustness in our analysis and modeling.

## Correlation Analysis

Correlation analysis helps us understand the relationship between happiness scores and socio-economic factors. We calculate correlation coefficients between happiness scores and individual features across multiple years. This analysis provides insights into which factors have the strongest association with happiness and how these relationships vary over time.

## Conclusion

This project offers a comprehensive analysis of the World Happiness Index data, spanning five years from 2015 to 2019. By examining trends, detecting outliers, and conducting correlation analysis, we gain valuable insights into the factors influencing happiness levels worldwide. These insights can inform policymakers, researchers, and organizations working to promote well-being and improve quality of life globally.
